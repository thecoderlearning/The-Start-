The link element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. Here is the basic syntax for using the link element for an external CSS file:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
The rel attribute is used to specify the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document. In this situation, we need to specify that this linked resource is a stylesheet.

It is considered best practice to separate your HTML and CSS in different files. Developers will use the link element for their external CSS file instead of writing everything in the HTML document.

The href attribute is used to specify the location of the URL for the external resource.

The dot followed by a forward slash in the example tells the computer to look in the current folder, or directory, for the styles.css file.

The link element should be placed inside the head element as seen in the following example:

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Examples of the link element</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
</head>

Often times you will see multiple link elements inside a professional codebase that link to different stylesheets, fonts, and icons. Here is an example of using the link element to link to an external Google Font called Playwright Cuba:

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin />
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Playwrite+CU:wght@100..400&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>

Google Fonts are a set of free and open source custom fonts that you can use inside any project. You can choose which fonts you would like to use and Google will provide you with the necessary HTML and CSS code. 
the preconnect value for the rel attribute tells the browser to create an early connection to the value specified in the href attribute. This is done to speed up loading times for these external resources.
Another common use case for the link element is to link to icons. Here is an example of linking to a favicon:

<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" />
