Step 31
        <figure>
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg">
        </figure>
Step 32 
To improve the accessibility of the image you added, add an alt attribute with the text:

Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch.
          <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch.">
Step 33
add figure caption 
Step 34
The strong element is used to indicate that some text is of strong importance or urgent.

In the figcaption you just added, indicate that hate is of strong importance by wrapping it in a strong element.
Step 35
The footer element is used to define a footer for a document or section. A footer typically contains information about the author of the document, copyright data, links to terms of use, contact information, and more.

After the main element, add a footer element.
    </main>
  <footer>
  </footer>
  </body>
Step 36
Nest a p element with the text No Copyright - freeCodeCamp.org within the footer element.
Step 37
Turn the existing freeCodeCamp.org text into a link by enclosing it in an anchor (a) element. The href attribute should be set to https://www.freecodecamp.org.
      <p>No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
      </p>
Step 38
Notice that everything you've added to the page so far is inside the body element. All page content elements that should be rendered to the page go inside the body element. However, other important information goes inside the head element.

The head element is used to contain metadata about the document, such as its title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. Metadata is information about the page that isn't displayed directly on the page.

Add a head element above the body element.
<html>
  <head>
    </head>
  <body>
Step 39 
The title element determines what browsers show in the title bar or tab for the page.

Add a title element within the head element using the text below:
Step 40 
element is <> </> attribute is <hmtl lang>

CatPhotoApp
Step 41
All pages should begin with <!DOCTYPE html>. This special string is known as a declaration and ensures the browser tries to meet industry-wide specifications.

<!DOCTYPE html> tells browsers that the document is an HTML5 document which is the latest version of HTML.

Add this declaration as the first line of the code.
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

Step 42 
<meta attribute="value">
